Parsing addresses with Google Geocoding API - This is my personal project to parse addresses in free text input to formatted addresses which include address(street # and route for example), city, state, zipcode and country.

## Google Geocoding API
The API returns latitude/longitude coordinates and normalized address information.  This can be used to perform address validation, real time mapping of user-entered addresses, distance calculations, and much more.

## API Keys
Google allows anonymous access to it's API, but if you start hitting rate limits, you must [sign up for a new Server API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key).

Bing [requires an API key](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff428642.aspx) to access its service.

You will need a [consumer secret and consumer key](http://developer.yahoo.com/boss/geo/BOSS_Signup.pdf) (PDF) for Yahoo.

MapQuest API requires a key. Sign up here: (http://developer.mapquest.com/web/products/open)
